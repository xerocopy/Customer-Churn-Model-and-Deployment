    "\n",
    "Bank XYZ has been observing a lot of customers closing their accounts or switching to competitor banks over the past couple of quarters. As such, this has caused a huge dent in the quarterly revenues and might drastically affect annual revenues for the ongoing financial year, causing stocks to plunge and market cap to reduce by X %. A team of business, product, engineering and data science folks have been put together to arrest this slide. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Objective__ : Can we build a model to predict, with a reasonable accuracy, the customers who are going to churn in the near future? Being able to accurately estimate when they are going to churn will be an added bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition of churn__ : A customer having closed all their active accounts with the bank is said to have churned. Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for 6 months or 1 year can also be defined as to have churned, based on the business requirements "

Instead, periodic (monthly/quarterly) model runs could be made and the list of customers, along with their propensity to churn shared with the business (Sales/Marketing) or Product team\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Action to be taken based on model's output/insights : Based on the output obtained from Data Science team as above, various business interventions can be made to save the customer from getting churned. Customer-centric bank offers, getting in touch with customers to address grievances etc. Here, also Data Science team can help with basic EDA to highlight different customer groups/segments and the appropriate intervention to be applied against them"

    " - How frequently are customer features updated?\n",
    " - Will it be possible to have the values of these features over a period of time as opposed to a single, snapshot date?\n",
    " - Some customers who have exited still have balance in their account, or a non-zero NumOfProducts. Does this mean they have churned only from a specific product and not the entire bank, or are these snapshots of just before they churned?\n",
    " - Some features like, number and kind of transactions, can help us estimate the degree of activity of the customer, instead of trusting the binary variable IsActiveMember\n",
    " - Customer transaction patterns can also help us ascertain whether the customer has actually churned or not. For example, a customer might transact daily/weekly vs a customer who transacts annuallly\n",
